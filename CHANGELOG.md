# Changelog

## v1.0.1 (2026-04-04)

### Patch Release — CI Fix and Package Metadata Polish

#### Fixed
- **CI**: Resolved `Invalid Version` npm error in GitHub Actions by adding `version` field to root `package.json` and regenerating `package-lock.json` from scratch
- **typedoc**: Updated `typedoc` from `^0.26.0` to `^0.28.0` and `typedoc-plugin-markdown` from `^4.0.0` to `^5.0.0` to resolve peer dependency conflict with `typescript@^5.7`
- **Dependencies**: Fixed `@better-logger/core` dependency reference from `^1.0.1` (unpublished) back to `^1.0.0`

#### Improved
- All 11 packages now have proper `description`, `license`, `repository` (with `directory`), and `keywords` fields
- Root `package.json` includes `docs:dev`, `docs:build`, `typecheck` scripts
- `package-lock.json` regenerated cleanly with npm workspaces — no pnpm migration artifacts
