## 1. Executive Summary

`better-pwa` is a unified PWA runtime and development platform that transforms Progressive Web Apps from "cached websites" into **production-grade, native-feeling applications**. It provides a single, reactive source of truth for application state, a complete lifecycle management system, and robust offline data synchronization—all with zero framework lock-in.

**Key Value Proposition:** Ship a PWA with native-level reliability, observability, and user experience using a single, cohesive API surface.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Current State of PWA Ecosystem (2026)

PWA tooling is **engineering-complete** but **product-broken**. While individual APIs exist (Project Fugu, Workbox, Manifest APIs), the orchestration layer that turns them into a cohesive, production-grade application is absent.

### 2.2 Pain Points

| Pain Point | Description | Impact |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Update Chaos** | No standard for managing "soft" vs "hard" updates, background swaps, or gradual rollouts. Developers manually implement update detection, user prompts, and activation logic. | High — Inconsistent UX, broken sessions, user frustration |
| **Permission Hell** | Fragmented, one-off permission requests with no batch coordination, state persistence, or graceful degradation. | High — Low conversion rates, permission fatigue |
| **Data Inconsistency** | Asset caching is solved, but offline data synchronization, mutation queuing, and conflict resolution are unsolved at the framework level. | Critical — Apps break offline, data loss on reconnect |
| **State Fragmentation** | No single source of truth for environment state (`navigator.onLine`, install status, permissions, storage quotas, SW lifecycle). | High — Race conditions, inconsistent UI across tabs |
| **Boilerplate Overhead** | Teams spend 2-4 weeks per project reimplementing lifecycle management instead of building features. | Medium — Slows velocity, increases time-to-market |

### 2.3 Impact Quantification

- **70%+ of PWA failures** in production stem from update/permission mismanagement (internal telemetry).
- **Average 3-5 weeks** of engineering effort per project on PWA boilerplate.
- **Zero standardized patterns** for offline mutation replay in the JS ecosystem.

---

## 3. Product Vision & Goals

### 3.1 Vision

`better-pwa` is the **Operating System Layer** between the browser and the application. It owns the full lifecycle of a web app—from installation and permission orchestration to offline data consistency and update UX—providing a single, reactive "State of the App" engine.

### 3.2 Strategic Goals

| Goal | Description | Target Metric |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Complete Lifecycle Ownership** | Control every stage: Install → Update → Permission → Sync → Telemetry | 100% coverage of PWA lifecycle |
| **Reactive Environment State** | Single source of truth for all app-level environment variables | <50ms state propagation across tabs |
| **Zero-Dependency Core** | Pure JS/TS, no framework lock-in, <15KB gzipped | Core bundle <15KB (gzip) |
| **Plugin-First Extensibility** | Lean core with extensible architecture for auth, payments, device APIs | Plugin API stability by v0.4 |
| **Growth-Focused** | Built-in intelligence for install conversion and user engagement | 2x improvement in install prompt conversion |

### 3.3 Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)

- **Not a UI Framework:** `better-pwa` provides state hooks and lifecycle primitives, not components.
- **Not a Replacement for Workbox:** We build *on top of* Workbox for precaching; we focus on orchestration.
- **Not a Backend:** Offline sync is client-side only. Server coordination is via webhooks/events, not server logic.
- **Not a Polyfill Layer:** Targets 2026+ browsers (Chromium 130+, Safari 18+, Firefox 130+). Legacy support is out of scope.

---

## 4. Target Audience & Use Cases

### 4.1 Primary Personas

| Persona | Role | Key Needs | Pain Points Solved |
|---------|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Product Engineer** | Frontend/Full-stack dev shipping customer-facing apps | "Native-feel" with minimal boilerplate, reliable offline UX | Update chaos, permission fatigue, offline breaks |
| **Enterprise Platform Team** | Internal tooling, infrastructure, compliance | Observability, security, multi-tab coordination, auditability | No centralized control, compliance gaps |
| **SaaS Builder** | Founder/tech lead building subscription tools | High reliability, offline capability, growth optimization | Time-to-market, user retention, install rates |

### 4.2 Key Use Cases

1. **E-Commerce PWA:** Offline cart persistence, background sync for checkout, graceful update handling during active sessions.
2. **Field Service App:** Offline mutation queue for work orders, batched permission requests for camera/location, multi-tab sync across devices.
3. **SaaS Dashboard:** Reactive offline state, install prompt optimization, gradual update rollouts without disrupting active users.

---

## 5. Core Principles & Design Tenets

| Principle | Rationale | Implementation Guideline |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Lifecycle Ownership** | PWAs fail at edges (install, update, offline). We own every edge case. | Every lifecycle event is tracked, exposed, and actionable via API. |
| **Reactive Environment State** | State fragmentation causes race conditions. One source of truth eliminates them. | `pwa.state()` is the only API for environment data. Auto-syncs across tabs. |
| **Zero-Dependency Core** | Framework lock-in kills adoption. Pure JS/TS maximizes reach. | No React/Vue/Svelte in core. Adapters are separate packages. |
| **Plugin Architecture** | Core must stay lean; extensions are domain-specific. | `pwa.use(plugin)` pattern. Core does not ship with auth/payments/device APIs. |
| **Growth-Focused** | PWAs exist to convert and retain. Every feature should improve metrics. | Install optimization, engagement-based prompts, analytics hooks built-in. |
| **Secure-by-Default** | Security is not optional. Defaults should be production-safe. | CSP presets, permission policy headers, scope isolation out of the box. |

---

## 6. Feature Specifications

### 6.1 State of the App Engine

**Description:** A unified, reactive state object that serves as the single source of truth for all application environment variables.

**API Contract:**
```typescript
interface PwaState {
  isOffline: boolean;           // Network connectivity status
  isInstalled: boolean;         // PWA install state (manifest + beforeinstallprompt)
  hasUpdate: boolean | string;  // Update available (true | version string)
  permissions: PermissionMap;   // Live state of requested permissions
  storage: StorageQuota;        // Quota, usage, active engine
}

// Reactive access
pwa.state().subscribe(callback)
pwa.state().snapshot() // Current state
```

**Behavioral Requirements:**
- State changes propagate to all open tabs within 50ms via BroadcastChannel.
- State is persisted to IndexedDB for cross-session consistency.
- Framework adapters (React, Vue, Svelte) expose state as hooks/composables.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ State updates are atomic and consistent across tabs.
- ✅ No race conditions between SW and main thread state.
- ✅ Framework adapters render state changes within 1 frame.

---

### 6.2 Update UX System

**Description:** Declarative strategies for managing service worker updates, background swaps, gradual rollouts, and custom UI prompts.

**Update Strategies:**

| Strategy | Behavior | Use Case |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `soft` | New SW activates in background; current session continues. Prompt on next load. | Content sites, dashboards |
| `hard` | Immediate reload with new SW. Active sessions are terminated. | Critical bug fixes, security patches |
| `gradual` | X% of users get update over Y hours. Configurable via `pwa.update.rollout(0.2, 4h)`. | Large user bases, A/B testing |
| `on-reload` | Update applies only when user navigates away and returns. | E-commerce, long-session apps |

**API Contract:**
```typescript
pwa.update.setStrategy("gradual", { rollout: 0.2, window: "4h" })
pwa.update.on("update_available", (version) => showPrompt(version))
pwa.update.activate() // Triggers immediate activation
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Update detection within 1 SW lifecycle tick.
- ✅ Strategy switching is runtime-configurable.
- ✅ No update loops or double-activations.

---

### 6.3 Permission Orchestrator

**Description:** Batched, state-tracked, and resilient permission management with retry logic and fallback handling.

**API Contract:**
```typescript
pwa.permissions.request(["camera", "microphone", "file-system"])
pwa.permissions.status() // { camera: "granted", microphone: "denied", ... }
pwa.permissions.on("denied", (perm, fallback) => fallback.show())
```

**Behavioral Requirements:**
- Batched requests are presented as a single UI flow (where browser supports it).
- Denied permissions trigger customizable fallback UI hooks.
- Permission state is cached and re-evaluated on focus/visibilitychange.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Batch requests reduce permission prompts by 60%+.
- ✅ Fallback UI is shown within 200ms of denial.
- ✅ Permission state is consistent across tabs.

---

### 6.4 Offline Data Layer

**Description:** Mutation queuing, optimistic updates, and conflict resolution for offline-first applications.

**Architecture:**
```
[UI Action] → [Optimistic Update] → [Mutation Queue] → [Network]
                                      ↓ (offline)
                                 Queue persists
                                      ↓ (online)
                              [Replay Engine] → [Server]
```

**Conflict Resolution Strategies:**
- `last-write-wins`: Simple overwrite (default for non-critical data).
- `merge`: Attempt automatic merge (JSON-mergeable structures).
- `manual`: Queue conflict, expose to app for resolution.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Mutation queue survives page reloads and browser restarts.
- ✅ Replay engine guarantees at-least-once delivery.
- ✅ Conflict resolution strategy is configurable per queue.

---

### 6.5 Storage Strategy Abstraction

**Description:** Unified API for OPFS, IndexedDB, and memory with quota monitoring and intelligent eviction.

**Storage Hierarchy (Auto-Selected):**
```
OPFS (Origin Private File System) → IndexedDB → Memory
  [Best for files/large data]       [Structured]  [Fallback]
```

**API Contract:**
```typescript
pwa.storage.set("key", value, { engine: "auto" })
pwa.storage.get("key")
pwa.storage.quota() // { usage: 45MB, quota: 2GB, percent: 2.25 }
pwa.storage.evict(policy: "lru" | "lfu" | "ttl")
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Engine selection is transparent and configurable.
- ✅ Quota monitoring triggers eviction before app breaks.
- ✅ Eviction policies respect TTL and access patterns.

---

### 6.6 Multi-Tab Sync

**Description:** Shared SW state and BroadcastChannel coordination for app-wide consistency.

**Mechanism:**
- **Sync Leader Election:** One tab is elected "leader" for SW coordination and mutation replay.
- **State Broadcasting:** All state changes are propagated via BroadcastChannel with deduplication.
- **Tab Lifecycle:** Tabs announce join/leave events for accurate active-user counting.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Leader election completes within 100ms.
- ✅ State propagation latency <50ms across tabs.
- ✅ No duplicate mutation replays during leader transitions.

---

### 6.7 Observability & Security

**Observability:**
- **Event Bus:** Unified hook for SW crashes, cache failures, permission events, sync errors.
- **Telemetry Adapter:** Pluggable interface for Datadog, Sentry, custom endpoints.
- **CLI Diagnostics:** `better-pwa doctor` for CI/CD and local health checks.

**Security:**
- **CSP Presets:** `strict`, `moderate`, `relaxed` configurations.
- **Permission Policy Headers:** Auto-generated `Permissions-Policy` headers.
- **Scope Isolation:** Manifest `scope` enforcement for subpath PWAs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ All lifecycle events are observable and loggable.
- ✅ CSP presets pass Lighthouse security audit.
- ✅ `doctor` CLI catches 95% of misconfigurations.

---

## 6.8 Enterprise Control Layer (v1.1)

**Description:** The layers that make better-pwa safe for Fortune 500 deployments: auth continuity, network intelligence, audit logging, policy enforcement, disaster recovery, and SLA metrics.

### 6.8.1 Auth Guard & Session Continuity

**API Contract:**
```typescript
const profile = pwa.network.profile()
// Returns: "slow" | "unstable" | "fast"
```

**Behavioral Requirements:**
- Adaptive sync behavior based on network quality
- Slow/unstable: defer sync, reduce retries
- Fast: aggressive replay, parallel requests
- Per-request network quality tagging

### 6.8.3 Audit Log System

**API Contract:**
```typescript
pwa.audit.log({
  action: "mutation_replay",
  actor: "user-123",

### 6.8.4 Policy Engine

**API Contract:**
```typescript
pwa.policy.enforce({
  offline: "allowed",
  storageLimit: "500mb",
  permissions: ["camera:denied"],
  maxQueueDepth: 1000
})
```

**Behavioral Requirements:**
- Declarative policy config (JSON/YAML)
- Admin-defined rules enforced at runtime
- Policy violations → audit log
- Enterprise SSO/MDM compatibility

### 6.8.5 Feature Flags

**API Contract:**
```typescript
pwa.flags.isEnabled("new_sync_engine")  // boolean
```

**Behavioral Requirements:**
- Remote flag polling (configurable endpoint)
- Integration with rollout/update system
- A/B testing support (percentage-based)
- Flag state visible in debug mode

### 6.8.6 Disaster Recovery

**API Contract:**
```typescript
pwa.recovery.reset({ preserve: ["auth", "settings"] })
```

**Behavioral Requirements:**
- Nuclear option with selective preservation
- Storage corruption detection (IDB integrity checks)
- Mutation queue overflow handling
- Emergency rollback to known-good version

### 6.8.7 SLA / Reliability Metrics

**API Contract:**
```typescript
const metrics = pwa.metrics.get()
// { uptime: 99.7, syncSuccessRate: 99.2, meanReplayTime: "1.3s", failureRate: 0.8 }
```

**Behavioral Requirements:**
- Uptime, sync success rate, failure rate, mean replay time
- Export to Datadog/Grafana formats
- Alerting thresholds (emit events when SLA degrades)

---

## 7. Non-Goals / Out of Scope

(See [Section 3.3](#33-non-goals-explicitly-out-of-scope))

Additional clarifications:
- Server-side rendering (SSR/SSG) is handled by framework adapters, not core.
- Push notification payload management is out of scope (v1.0 covers delivery, not content).
- Payment processing is a plugin, not core functionality.

---
