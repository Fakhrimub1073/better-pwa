## 1. Roadmap Overview

### 1.1 Timeline Summary

| Phase | Version | Theme | Target Date | Duration |
|-------|---------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Phase 1** | v0.1 | Modern Core & State | April 2026 | 4 weeks |
| **Phase 2** | v0.2 | Update UX & Permissions | May 2026 | 4 weeks |
| **Phase 3** | v0.3 | Data Consistency & Storage | June 2026 | 4 weeks |
| **Phase 4** | v0.4 | Platform-Level Coordination | July 2026 | 4 weeks |
| **Phase 5** | v1.0 | Full Stack Release | August 2026 | 6 weeks |

### 1.2 Release Philosophy

- **Semantic Versioning:** `v0.x` denotes pre-1.0 (API may change). `v1.0` is API-stable.
- **Incremental Value:** Each phase delivers standalone production value. No phase is blocked by future work.
- **Dogfooding:** Each phase is tested against a real PWA before release.
- **Feature Flags:** Unstable features are gated; stable features remain unaffected by WIP.
